    "RabbitMQ is a robust messaging broker that allows applications to communicate asynchronously. It supports a variety of messaging protocols and is widely used for managing message queues between distributed systems.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Set up RabbitMQ using Docker.\n",
    "- Interact with RabbitMQ using Python to send and receive messages.\n",
    "- Understand basic concepts like producers, consumers, and queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. You can install Docker by following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n",
    "\n",
