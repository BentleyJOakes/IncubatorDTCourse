    "## What is a Digital Twin (DT) Service?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the incubator digital twin, a service is a process that communicates via a [RabbitMQ message exchange](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), running within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) container. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DT Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are two types of services:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server Services**  \n",
    "   These services operate similarly to a client-server model. They perform actions only in response to RabbitMQ messages that encapsulate requests for specific computations. Once the computation is completed, the result is sent back as a RabbitMQ message in response to the original request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reactive Services**  \n",
    "   These services subscribe to a particular RabbitMQ topic. When a message arrives on the subscribed topic, they perform a computation and publish the result to another RabbitMQ topic. Other services can then subscribe to the topic where the result is published, allowing a chain of computations across services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Services\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples demonstrate one of each service type, including a mixed service that both acts as a client server, but also has ongoing computation as a reactive service. The examples also make the services communicate with each other and the incubator physical twin. Altogether these services give you everything you need to build your own digital twin services using rabbitmq.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AverageService**: This is a server service that computes the average of a given list of values.\n",
    "- **MovingAverageTemperatureService**: This is a hybrid service that maintains a moving average of the last N values of the temperature in the incubator. It communicates with the average service to get the average. In addition, as a server, it responds to requests to reset the moving average.\n",
    "- **PTReconfigurationService**: This is a reactive service that reconfigures the incubator physical twin whenever the difference between the temperature moving average and the actual temperature is high. It uses the values of the `MovingAverageTemperatureService`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Most services use the configuration file located at the [startup.conf](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/example_digital-twin_incubator/tree/master/software) of the incubator DT project for parameters such as RabbitMQ connection details and other settings."

    "## Logging configuration for services\n",
    "\n",
    "Each service will use the standard logging framework from Python. We use a single logging configuration file for all services, and adjust it as needed. This makes it easier to quickly configure the logging for the different services we will create.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging configuration in the next cell defines at least two loggers (`root` and `AverageService`), two handlers (`consoleHandler` and `AverageServiceFileHandler`), and one formatter (`simpleFormatter`). Here's a detailed explanation of what each section does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Loggers**\n",
    "Loggers are components that generate log messages. This configuration defines at least two loggers:\n",
    "- `root`: This is the default logger that all other loggers inherit from unless otherwise specified. It will capture log messages from the entire application.\n",
    "- `AverageService`: This is a specific logger named `AverageService`, which logs messages related to the `AverageService` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Handlers**\n",
    "Handlers are responsible for deciding where the log messages go (e.g., to a file, console, etc.). This configuration defines at least two handlers:\n",
    "- `consoleHandler`: Sends log messages to the console (or terminal) using `sys.stdout`.\n",
    "- `AverageServiceFileHandler`: Sends log messages from the `AverageService` logger to a file named `AverageService.log`. It opens the file in write mode (`'w'`), meaning it will overwrite the file each time the logger is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Formatters**\n",
    "The formatter defines the format of the log messages:\n",
    "- **`simpleFormatter`**: This formatter formats log messages with the following pattern:  \n",
    "  `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(levelname)s %(name)s : %(message)s`  \n",
    "  - `%(asctime)s`: Timestamp of the log event.\n",
    "  - `%(msecs)03d`: Milliseconds portion of the time, padded to 3 digits.\n",
    "  - `%(levelname)s`: The log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO).\n",
    "  - `%(name)s`: The name of the logger (e.g., `AverageService`).\n",
    "  - `%(message)s`: The actual log message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The `datefmt` specifies the date format as `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Logging Configuration Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[loggers]**\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "[loggers]\n",
    "keys=root,AverageService\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This section defines at least two loggers, `root` and `AverageService`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[logger_root]**\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "[logger_root]\n",
    "level=DEBUG\n",
    "handlers=consoleHandler\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `root` logger is set to capture log messages at the `DEBUG` level or higher. The `consoleHandler` is used to send these log messages to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[logger_AverageService]**\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "[logger_AverageService]\n",
    "level=DEBUG\n",
    "handlers=AverageServiceFileHandler\n",
    "qualname=AverageService\n",
    "propagate=0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This logger captures log messages for the `AverageService` component, at the `DEBUG` level or higher, and sends them to the `AverageService.log` file.\n",
    "- `qualname=AverageService`: This logger is used when you call `logging.getLogger('AverageService')` in your code.\n",
    "- `propagate=0`: This prevents log messages from being passed to the parent logger (i.e., the `root` logger), meaning logs from `AverageService` will not appear in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[handlers]**\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "[handlers]\n",
    "keys=consoleHandler,AverageServiceFileHandler\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This defines at least two handlers: one for the console and one for the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[handler_consoleHandler]**\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "[handler_consoleHandler]\n",
    "class=StreamHandler\n",
    "formatter=simpleFormatter\n",
    "args=(sys.stdout,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This handler sends log messages to the console (standard output).\n",
    "- It uses the `simpleFormatter` to format the log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **[handler_AverageServiceFileHandler]**\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "[handler_AverageServiceFileHandler]\n",
    "class=FileHandler\n",
    "formatter=simpleFormatter\n",
    "args=('AverageService.log', 'w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This handler sends log messages to the `AverageService.log` file.\n",
    "- The file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), meaning the contents are overwritten each time logging occurs.\n",
    "- It also uses the `simpleFormatter` for formatting log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **How It Works in Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Logger**: Any logs from the rest of your application that don't specify a logger will be handled by the `root` logger. These logs will appear in the console.\n",
    "- **AverageService Logger**: Logs specifically generated by `logging.getLogger('AverageService')` will be written to the `AverageService.log` file. These logs will not propagate to the `root` logger, meaning they won’t appear in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import logging.config\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the logging configuration\n",
    "logging.config.fileConfig('logging.conf')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the AverageService logger\n",
    "average_service_logger = logging.getLogger('AverageService')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log a message using AverageService logger\n",
    "average_service_logger.debug(\"This is a debug message for AverageService.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log a message using the root logger\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a debug message for root.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message for `AverageService`**: Will be logged in `AverageService.log`.\n",
    "- **Message for `root`**: Will appear in the console."
