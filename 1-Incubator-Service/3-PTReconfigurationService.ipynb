    "# Physical Twin Reconfiguration Service\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a reactive service that reconfigures the incubator physical twin (PT) whenever the difference between the temperature moving average and the actual temperature is high. It uses the values of the `MovingAverageTemperatureService` and matches them with the values coming from the physical twin.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slight technicality is that the messages containing the moving average temperature (from `MovingAverageTemperatureService`), and the temperature (coming from the PT) come from two different sources. They are ordered according to timestamp in each of the corresponding sources but the order of their arrival is not necessarily by increasing value of timestamp. This means this service needs to aggregate them and rely on them having the same timestamp to conclude that a given moving temperature message corresponds to a given temperature measured. This is a process similar to the merge phase of the [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm to perform this alignment is illustrated in the following state machine which is then implemented in the PT reconfiguration service:\n",
