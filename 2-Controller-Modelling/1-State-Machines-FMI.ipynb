    "# Modelling State Machines in Python FMUs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to simulate state machines in Python using an API that allows for step-wise simulation, similar to co-simulation in the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard](https://fmi-standard.org/). We will cover the basics of state machines, implement the state machine logic in pure Python, and simulate it step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a State Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **state machine** is a computational model used to design systems with a finite number of states. The system transitions between these states based on events or conditions. State machines are widely used in embedded systems, software design, protocols, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concepts in state machines are:\n",
    "1. **States**: Different conditions or situations that the machine can be in.\n",
    "2. **Events**: Triggers that cause transitions from one state to another.\n",
    "3. **Transitions**: Rules that define when and how to move between states based on events or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)** is an open standard for exchanging dynamic models between different simulation environments. It enables the co-simulation and model exchange of complex systems across various tools and platforms. FMI defines a standardized interface for model-based design and allows for simulation interoperability by providing models packaged as **Functional Mockup Units (FMUs)**. FMUs can be imported into different simulation environments to simulate, test, and optimize system behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in FMI\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FMU (Functional Mockup Unit)**:\n",
    "   - An FMU is a self-contained package, usually represented as a `.fmu` file, that contains the model's source code or binaries and metadata describing the model’s interfaces.\n",
    "   - An FMU can be used for **model exchange** (where only the model equations are exchanged) or **co-simulation** (where the FMU contains its solver).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Exchange vs Co-Simulation**:\n",
    "   - **Model Exchange**: The FMU provides the model equations, but the simulation environment provides the solver. This is suitable when the FMU is integrated into a larger simulation.\n",
    "   - **Co-Simulation**: The FMU includes both the model and the solver. The simulation environment manages communication with the FMU during co-simulation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **FMI Interface**:\n",
    "   - FMUs implement a set of standardized functions that allow the importing simulation tool to interact with the FMU. These include initialization, stepping the simulation, getting and setting variables, and cleaning up resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of an FMU\n",
    "\n",
    "An FMU package typically includes:\n",
    "- **Model Description (`modelDescription.xml`)**: An XML file that describes the model’s variables, parameters, and interfaces.\n",
    "- **C Code or Binaries**: Implementations of the model and/or solver in compiled binaries.\n",
    "- **Resources**: Any additional files required by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FMU Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instantiation**: The importing tool loads the FMU and reads its metadata.\n",
    "2. **Initialization**: The FMU initializes its internal state based on input values.\n",
    "3. **Simulation Steps**: The importing tool simulates the FMU over time by performing simulation steps.\n",
    "4. **Termination**: The simulation ends, and resources are released.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU) in Pure Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Although FMUs are generally implemented in C/C++ for performance reasons, it is possible to create a simple FMU in Python for educational purposes. Below, we simulate the core principles of an FMU in Python using a step-wise simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates a simple **co-simulation FMU** in Python, simulating a temperature controlled system, represented as a state machine.\n"
