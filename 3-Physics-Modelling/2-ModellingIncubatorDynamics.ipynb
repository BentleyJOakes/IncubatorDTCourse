    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete Simulation in a While Loop**:\n",
    "   - The simulation is now performed in a `while` loop, where each iteration advances the simulation by a fixed time step (`time_step = 3.0` seconds). Think of this as the execution interval of the controller that turns on and off the heater.\n",
    "   - At each time step, the current state (`T_h`, `T_b`) is updated by solving the system of ODEs using `solve_ivp` over the current time window (`[current_time, next_time]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heater Switch**:\n",
    "   - The `heater_switch(t)` function determines whether the heater is on or off based on the current time. The heater is on for the first 1800 seconds (`t < 1800`) and off afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updating the State**:\n",
    "   - After each call to `solve_ivp`, we update the state (`T_h`, `T_b`) with the final values of the current solution segment. These updated values are used as the initial condition for the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Storing and Plotting the Results**:\n",
    "   - We store the time and temperature values (`t_values`, `Th_values`, and `Tb_values`) at each step, and once the loop is done, we plot the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output plot will show two temperature curves:\n",
    "- **Heater Temperature (`T_h`)**: The temperature of the heater increases when the heater is on, and starts to cool down when the heater is turned off at 1800 seconds.\n",
    "- **Box Temperature (`T_b`)**: The temperature of the box follows a similar pattern but with a lag due to the thermal conductivity between the heater and the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a red dashed line is plotted at 1800 seconds, indicating the point where the heater is turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- The simulation runs step-by-step in a `while` loop, making it easy to handle discrete changes in the control inputs (like turning the heater on and off).\n",
    "- You could also change room temperature over time following this approach.\n",
    "- This approach provides fine-grained control over the simulation, allowing you to handle dynamic inputs and external events at each time step."
